Done. Try it in any project directory:
  cmux-gallery run        # build + serve + open in cmux (keep the pane open)
  cmux-gallery build      # just write the HTML (no server)

To keep the server alive automatically (recommended), copy dock.example.json
into the project's .cmux/dock.json — see the README "Keeping it running" section.
